0	Identical but irrelevant RT : Did anyone think of comparing the clothes that was wearing to the security footage?
1	no, because that would require reasoning and then if reasoning is applied, no one can be shot. Shoot now, reason later.
2	
3	is it me, or the dude in the security cam photos is bald? Mike Brown isn't bald i dont belive
4	it's not him lmao the store owners already said so
5	my God sucks
6	. yes. They don't match. Flip flops + hat in store. Shoes + no hat in final pic.
7	It's a good thing u went to detective school....wat would the cops do w/o u?
8	yes hat and sandals vs no hat and tennis shoes
9	I thought the same thing.
10	had the same flip flops on.
11	Did anyone think that, holy balls, he was old enough to know how to change his clothes?
12	Yeah. just did on CNN.
13	No but it def softens the blow.
14	Even if he had robbed a convenience store, that's no excuse for murder.
15	it's not race were all targeted by the governments, cops, swat, FBI, they'll silence anyone who'll try to tell the truth
16	of course , however please do not try and compare it to hundreds of years of systemic oppression of a whole people
17	Good job, faggots. You IDd the wrong man.
18	BAM ANTI-WHITES get caught with their foot in their mouth in front of the WORLD LMAO
19	anti-whites ?
20	yup Anti-Racist is a codeword for ANTI-WHITE
21	A robbery doesn't excuse an execution style murder I don't give a fuck what anyone says. Swisher Sweets aren't worth a life.
22	corny, but only TRUE evil wants Us to believe INERT OBJECTS are more valuable than LIFE! --GBJ
23	Strong armed robbery, Assault on the store clerk, assaulting a police officer...and the info continues to come in.
24	? . From Murder in the st to a Gross Misdemeanor.
25	don't make this a race issue. The militarization of the police is the issue
26	it STARTED as a race issue, then people tried to SWAY it to an issue of militarization, dont get it twisted
27	You realize police brutality affects all races right?
28	you imagine the shitstorm if this guy was black? Doubt U heard about it
29	but because of the training that cops receive now is more military in manner they react overly aggressive towards us (non-cop)
30	well put. There are bigger issues the masses are finally starting to see.

70	they're asking people to stay indoors and don't go to the CBD. Why would you send drivers there?? Really disappointed of
71	what's not well-timed is what Huber is doing in a crisis situation. Uber has absolutely no integrity. Disgusting.
72	"“: Uber says it has hiked prices in Sydney to ""encourage more drivers to come online &amp; pick up ” Uber=ugly opportunism!"

75	. - I am OTR about distaste of surge pricing, but do you think your click bait story about Uber in Sydney is well timed + tasteful?
76	Uber is facing problems enough, will a price hike really help?
77	you might want to rethink your hashtag
78	They charged me $215 for a $20 fare. Neveer use them again after they've eloited situations.
79	. How altruistic of them!

83	If car can't get to rider, rider can't walk to car &amp; unable to schedule pickups, what is an rider to do?
84	You're reporting a report? What's your source?
85	here's to all the hostages getting safe passage on this day!
86	“: Reports two customers and an employee have escaped the
87	stranger by the second
88	Of course he did. It gave people time to solidify the opinions that they already had. It was a calculated move.
89	you know the cop didnt have to know about robbery for this video to have value. you're not very good at being stupid.
90	But she's very good at instigating and baiting....just like her mother. Smh
91	i had no idea that was her mom.
92	Yep!! Splitting image in everything except one has black hair and other blonde....
93	that's unfortunate. signed, ferguson PD
94	it's about changing the narrative.
95	And it is down right disrespectful to the young man and his family.
96	connects the robbery w shooting. dont have to be a genius. a guy who shoves clerk is s'posed to raise his hands later?
97	Shoving a clerk means you'll take on a police officer with a gun?
98	it prevented future crimes by
99	not necessarily. but it might show a particular disposition towards authority figures.
100	and who would blame them when those authority figures are gunning surrendering suspects down?
101	since the 'witness' version is incomplete/inaccurate the whole 'hands up' part prob isn't true either
102	I rolled through a stop sign once, the cop was shouting at me like I killed someone. I was terrified. They .
103	sad that happened to you. no doubt there are racist/ignorant cops. but not all, maybe not
104	Polluting potential jurors by any Chief of LEOs should be an intentional malice reprimand,+ the county DA may be his Advisor
105	Have to show Mike without clean hands somehow.
106	Chief needs to be removed from his job...I never meant this happen..don't insult our intelligence
107	I want to believe its total incompetence. But its was all on purpose to change public opinion. My guess is it will continue
108	Did the media ask for the video under FOIA as the Chief of Police said? And why was video released without commentary in am?
109	did of release the report filed by Wilson?
110	It's a strategy to manipulate media and misinform people.
111	he didn't say he didn't know about the robbery, it went out over radio, he said he didn't know was a suspect
112	For that reason precisely, media should refrain from connecting the two. Stay with the shooting story.
113	the chief said this am that cop was at a call for sick person, then got the call for store strong arm robbery
114	Incorrect. Was on sick person call &amp; then driving came across Brown &amp; friend walking &amp; asked they get off the road
115	i relistened to the press conf &amp; ur right i was wrong
116	It's like the 'connect the dots' books. If they sold cliff notes, they'd be outdated by day end. Bumbling idiots
117	seems like theres soo much about this case it gets confusing yet there isnt enough info??
118	Lisa is he the confirmed robber?
119	The people responsible for killing should not be in control of the evidence proving what happenend.
120	
121	but mike brown knew about the robbery and DIDN'T know the cop didn't know - that's what makes it POSSIBLY relevant
122	that's what I thought too...
123	LOL. million Muslims in France, what a disgrace. the french worm president and politicians killed them. tine for croissants now
124	MT France: dead after shooting at HQ of satirical weekly . If Zionists/Jews did this they'd be nuking Israel

147	As it should be, having a game on the same day as a is just asking for trouble.

149	Elderly people are subjected to toxic poison times legal limits but that does not seem important to CBC, CBS, or TC.
150	You can add A Chanel News &amp; Chek News to that group also. Letting people be subject to toxic poison is such a Victoria thing.

158	slag the Islamic people then sit back and watch what happens. Bomb Islamic people and watch what happens,

160	i knw u wld say tat...!! just becoz sum radicalised idiots are dng this doesnt mean tat we can blame d entire religion fr it..

162	then educate me..???
163	easily. Don't go to war in other country's and think it won't come home to you. Police shot person in America with hands up.
164	i wnt blame u fr saying this..bt u forgot hw many ppl's lives are being saved by these men...!!!

194	cant read arabic it could be anything More informed people tell me its a shadah flag which is generic
195	ah I see. The Shahadah having nothing to do with the Koran. Got you.
196	shahada flag is a generic flag, not unique to any group. ISIS use a different flag

232	Walking in the street while
233	no they did not
234	Wrong. The violent assault committed makes it more likely he attacked the cops minutes later.

239	they die in slut pink ass those white French, they disgusting why they slut pig die,i myself became more poor inside Paris no phone

245	I bet if Michael Brown had his druthers, he’d rather have his name dragged thru the mud than his life snuffed out.
246	The first goal is to get a conviction so he can never be a cop again.
247	SAY IT AGAIN!!!! oh nevermind, I can just RT it
248	damn surveillance video We give up a name, we drag his thru the mud.
249	People may not like it. but it's devastating for prosecuting the cop. If true, can be argued Brown thought the cop was after him .
250	Since they want to label as a shoplifter, since when is that crime punishable by DEATH?
251	Not sure 'shoot first &amp; uncover potential crime later' is viable policy outside the fevered mind of a conservative
252	Early reports said the store had not reported a robbery?? The people in the store don't look alarmed.
253	The point is, the cop didn't know about a robbery. He executed a jaywalker resisting being detained
254	EXACTLY!! Since when is jaywalking punishable by DEATH?
255	From what I saw it was nothing but a petty theft. Let the RT Wing tell it, he went in with a GLOCK
256	"AMEN to that!! They would say ""LOOK! HE PUSHED THAT STORE CLERK!!.. is that punishable by DEATH?"

301	anti semitism, inciting hatred is VERY dif than satire&amp;humor. Jews don't kill u forcartoon. Inciting hate tho is crime
302	what more hatred u want after abusing n Makin fun of the prophet. These guys who drew created hatred. Not attackers
303	Muslims are being persecuted for their religion? In Pakistan, Nigeria or Paris?
304	I have to say though, the honesty about the murderous tenets of your religion is refreshing.
305	look you fool we are talking revenge. If u abuse any religion . Revenge will be taken that simple
306	thanks tho for being honest about the Islamic excuses for murder
307	BS. NO other religion teaches that it's great to kill everyone else for whatever stupid reason islamics do
308	yes because islam is true religion. They don't take Bullshit from fools like Charlie Have died.

321	yeah? I'd like to see you respond this way to anti-Semitic children's programs on Gaza tv
322	you fool . We r not talking of Gaza. Anti semitsm and no laws anti protection of islam
323	why are we not talking of Gaza, ya sidi?
324	freedom of speech protects everyone. Islam just doesn't believe in freedom or democracy. Just death
325	where is Islam protected under freedom of speech. Show me any law. No law. So these guys right to kill
326	civilized countries have civilized laws that protect everyone. Islamics don't get murder &amp; say defense
327	what civilization. If you can abuse a religion and no law to protect any religion. So Muslims are guardians
328	no it's ok to offend everyone else. Precious pedophile needs to be protected
329	pedophiles is accepted in Judaism. Read torah. Who gave these fools right to make fun of Islam
330	but it seems clear that you agree that the legitimate response to the satire was murder.
331	lol moron I'm a rabbinical student. Don't tell me to find non existent things in the Torah

337	don't think any1 is having trouble understanding what this is about. Kind if silly to compare this to anti-Semitism
338	free speech. They made fun of everyone! Only islamics kill ppl for a joke. A cartoon. A little offense. No excuse
339	also in the creation of the zionist state it was a norm for jews to dress up as muslims and bomb people
340	go away. It's what arabs do
341	that's the problem. Muslims are serious in their only and one true religion. They won't abuse of jesus moses or mohammed

343	u heard it from me no muslim unless brainwashed will kill innocent people even if u abuse prophet
344	lots &amp; lots brainwashed then. Seeing ur comments shows how widespread
345	they are discusting animals
346	Muslims feel they r being attacked everywhere not even their religion. These tend to happen. No protection
347	Bcoz they r killing people! Slaughtering. 'In the name of their prophet' no one else is doing that.
348	sorry not in name of Prophet. In the name of God. Ezra to Jews is son of God. Just u guys r idol worship
349	I dont believe in any of them and certainly not worship them
350	yeah i feel really sorry for them
351	its not islamaphobia to call an Islamic terrorist what he is. Muslims r silent &amp; won't stand up
352	islam is not a religion its a brainwashed cult.
353	hehehe yah like Judaism Christianity and worst hinduism. This is what fools in churches call it. Because they are afraid
354	but the priests,rabbis&amp; ministers don't preach(kill all non moooslims) not yet but lets hope we get it on.easy prey.
355	so is free speach
356	settle down just came back from emirates,arabs r just fine its these brainwashed moooslims that r cause
357	disturbing.
358	Also security was abysmal and should have been heightened when so many threats had already happened towards this media agency
359	In France all Jewish official buldings including schools have to be tightly secured. Can't have police everywhere...
360	Hearts and prayers for families of these police and journalists
361	true but when you mock a religion every day - one should heighten security
362	CH mocks all religions. Only one replies with assault rifles. + there were policement there. Killed too.
363	There is no excuse - it is unacceptable always - we know in America how it feels
364	if state cannot control such irresponsible magazines making fun of people's faith then monsters come and do thejob.Face consequences
365	Hey buddy, I'm insulting your faith. Now go fuck yourself.
366	stay stupid and wait be the next victim. such trash like u cannot blame monsters. U deserve be punished by monsters
367	you,baboon, US media rejected to reprint those pictures finding them insulting.So go and fuck yourself u stupid boy
368	Hey buddy, I'm still insulting your faith and there's nothing you can do about it. Now go fuck yourself, loser.
369	Remember background: France, its Parliament &amp; Senate + some left-wgd municipalities bending over backwards to please Palestinians..
370	The Quran calls for the execution of who ever insults their prophet. They are doing what their hateful religion tells them to do.
371	Today we mourn with France but in the weeks to come France needs to do some soul searching and introspection
372	and lots of deportation
373	"Western leaders created terrorists with various Arabic ""springs"" by mercenaries jihadists.It was INEVITABLE to go west."
374	the real problem was letting these moooslims into the free world.ask politicans why we need them .moohammadd bedded MR.ED
375	u imposed dictators stole raw material both in africa and middle east
376	we stole it,ur shieks got all the money &amp; enslaved u &amp; ur women folk attack them u cowards.
377	prophet moohammadd bedded horses,nothing more nothing less
378	Islamic terror. Empowered by media that makes excuses for it. Can't blame the Jews this CNN. THIS is Islam
379	insulting others people faith cannot be called freedom of speech. Chief editor is one to blame. I Do not justify monsters-jail them
380	satire. Get it? Insults r free speech. Cowardice &amp; murder r not. Islamic terror is celebrated by its followers
381	u r not getting my point -monsters must be penalized. But entire society need to be responsible and not provoke monsters
382	infidels that r breathing offends these monsters. Freedom offends them.
383	reason forthis massacre is a concrete action of paper.not general principles of freedom.
384	no it was Islamic teaching that freedom of speech is offensive to Islam, but killing is just dandy
385	u r better eert. I doubt but I am not eert.If so than my question why western govts tolerate all those Muslim groups

724	now remember, even if your kids r in the cafe, no torturing anyone who might know anything if this happens in U.S.
725	Prayers
726	More workplace violence I'm sure !
727	Sydney needs to borrow some guns??
728	is that unusual?
729	Mayday is a call for urgent assistance. (M'aidez). Not a lot of help for a plane hurtling towards the floor.
730	mayday is French!
731	They made that call in French?
732	"Lots of radio protocol is French... Mayday is M'aidez. Urgence, pan-pan, ""see-lonce"" etc."
733	Roger. Just seems odd given most comms are in English. Doesn't make it wrong, of course.
734	Just historic. Also hard to confuse with other words, so clear for the listener.
735	Is that roughly equivalent to our 'Pan Pan' call it priority I assume?
736	No 'Pan Pan' call is universal
737	Ahh.. I was always taught it was a UK only thing; and having done only limited flying abroad never tested that!
738	what are the implications of this?
739	why would they say urgence in lieu of mayday which is standard ?
740	I hope I'm wrong, but sounded like shotgun blasts started activity...then automatic weapons fire. /2
741	I just pray the hostages will all live to see another day.
742	That would mean worst case: scumbag started shooting hostages and police responded. Hope that is not the case. /2
743	Should have snipered him.
744	I heard (who knows if it's true) there might be elosives. Not a good time to shot.
745	Aside from that, yeah.
746	This peaceful resolution shit just resulted in dead and wounded hostages
747	My only issue with shooting him in the head was that it's too quick of a death.
748	Again, so far as I can tell, they were worried about elosives, and it appears there was an elosion.
749	That was probably a flash-boom from police
750	No idea, but Muslim terrorists do love their elosives.

789	GERMAN NEWS: Co-Pilot of Germanwings Airbus Was MUSLIM CONVERT …’Hero of Islamic State’?
790	NOOOO
791	If TRUE, then we are late in taking conscience of the magnitude of evil brooding upon the civilised world.
792	Yup. I'm not trying tobe Islamophobic, but would anyone put their kid on a plane with a muslim pilot?
793	How would you know the pilot was Muslim?
794	a muslim convert? You start these lies.I hope he rots in his hell and you in a prison one if lying
795	that pilot attended mosques in Germany - religion of peace strikes again
796	how do you know?
797	I wouldn't put anyone on a bus with a muslim driver much less a plane.
798	no, nor a two men one.
799	"The question should be,"" Should any country other than muslim countries hire muslim pilots?"""

806	Of course, you have to crop have his face.
807	this isn't him clearly
808	omg stfu already. Did you see the clothes the kid was wearing, looked similar. Agree with you but quit fucking fishing.
809	lol there's a million dudes wearing cargos &amp; white tees everyday please stop
810	these pictures look damning, but stealing rillos DOES NOT JUSTIFY MURDER!
811	just so my opinion is clear; no way that kid should be dead, period! Anon ain't the vigilante he thinks
812	LIES! was not wanted robbery otherise his friend would hv been considered an accomplice...
813	this guy is way fatter than mike
814	I have a real civil rights idea that WILL work.
815	he stole a candy bar and was threatened the cops will come to resolve the issue
816	all I see is him walking in a store
817	if those kids were involved why would the officer just tell the kids to get on the sidewalk, not get on the ground?
818	didn't the manager of the store already say this was not true
819	oh hell of course
820	LIES
821	Now I dont even believe they gave the right name of the officer.one lie leads to another and another..they r buried in lies
822	I want to know what kind of vision the police have to clearly say this is Mike Brown! I can barely see a face
823	Even if connected, does that mean he should be shot times with his hands up on the ground?
824	Abbott will, will He anyone tell Him it hasn't finished yet...LOL.... no don't tell him..hear what he says
825	Abbott already did. And we don't know of it's the IS or al-Qaeda or some other Islamic group. You're so bad a reporter..
826	Of course it just HAD to be

837	Which is an insult to the Three Stooges, but I agree with your point hundred percent.
838	Yaaay you got Police Dept.

840	Thats because their SKANKERS

845	We are not obligated to sit passively, just waiting for these rapists to tear up our society! Arrest them NOW!!!
846	could nt agree more we need to speak up when we see something
847	Change the laws, change the reckless immigration policies! Sensitize people to be on the look-out! Get real, folks!
848	Can you lay off the politics right now? We know *nothing* about who did this, what's going on.
849	Right, there is no obvious context. How insightful of you!
850	I know I can't be insightful yet - that's the bloody point, neither can you, and by trying to, you lose ground.
851	Give it one hour and my points will be confirmed.
852	Canada needs to get real and recognize that this war is REAL; it's no joke. Arrest these monsters BEFORE they murder more of us!

854	“: police: Officer involved in fatal shooting of Michael Brown didn't know he was suspect. ridic
855	I believe the robbery actually did happen and is not alleged.
856	You thought of that all by yourself??? Amazingly Irrelevant!!!
857	i don't believe that is what he said. He said the stop was initially not about that. Previously, they said he knew of robbery and...
858	This point is irrelevant. What is important is what happened after the officer contacted the suspect.
859	Mike thought the coppers were on to him so he tried to assault the officer to get away. ..
860	This, and their militaristic approach to the problem, does not paint the Fergie PD in a favorable light
861	that's big
862	I am sure Cops go to work thinking what black kid can I shoot today and cause riots and Al Sharpton to speak again ..SMH
863	So he thought he will pick on this black kid because it was a slow day?
864	no justification needed...
865	I asked the guy at the airport. Why did you chose me for a search? He said it was random. I did not buy that.
866	nothing is random where the West is concerned...
867	had a description.
868	Go Back To Sleep Loraine!!!
869	How is robbery define by state law? Where are the reports from the shooting? Why no ambulance?
870	and Brown wasn't aware that the cop was unaware of the violent robbery Brown had just committed.
871	Hi, like, please)
872	NOTE TO SELF: Actions of committing amy crime, no matter how misqal may justify my death to some, regardless to how unwarranted.
873	when that didn't made logical sense, now it was jaywalking? And he felt the nd to use deadly force for jaywalking? Lol
874	"they've been throwing out one lie after another. And none of it makes sense. How was he ""prime suspect"" just minutes after?"
875	&lt;&lt;he didn't know at all they still has a B.O.L.O out at for the suspect
876	their account is getting worse and worse Roland
877	SUSPICION of a crime results n DEATH of the unarmed in the comm as a rule.
878	"Because jaywalking and stealing cigars are capital crimes. It's the classic ""Blame the victim"" defense."
879	It's a conniving way to do a smear campaign. Darren Wilson is a cold-blooded murderer.
880	may be prudent to ask clerk if Brown was the one who hit him
881	initially, but found out about the robbery during the altercation
882	ok so that was mike in the convenience store?
883	wasn't it just this morning they were saying it was the reason
884	Well, yeah. He had to trash the name of a dead child before providing that little tid bit.
885	"I'm not sure there was a ""robbery"". Convenience stores keep tobacco behind a counter where you PAY first! IJS"
886	if u watch the tape, he reached over counter, still not grounds to shoot him from behind
887	you can't tell whether there was somebody behind the counter or not. Either way not related to shooting.
888	I hear ya, but u said the swishers were behind the counter and they were, no biggie

895	I think you mean morons.
896	no - set them free in the streets of Paris &amp; give them a second head start.
897	They should tell them, no you'll just die as murderers, not martyrs
898	Agreed. Relevant and timely clarification: martyrs are assassinated, they're not the assassins.
899	"“ suspects ""prepared to die as martyrs"", they tell police after making contact. ” Previsível"
900	Just kill them. Nothing to see here, only cowards. Nothing lost.

902	No martyrs there, just cowards.
903	Punk Cowards

905	please don't starting saying these guys are marters, they are cold blooded murderers, you are fuelling what they want!
906	brainwashed!!
907	rubbish! Martyrs don't run away they should have faced consequences immediately.
908	so if they’d stayed at the scene they would have been martyrs?
909	they would still be murderers I don't think anyone can consider this martyrdom
910	"I don't think these type of Muslims know what the word ""martyr"" means."

912	thankfully the FBI is really good with lots of resources
913	shooting suspect
914	I want answers Why did I get netter News fom CNN And CBS ???
915	WHY??? its not their country
916	because it is a possible terrorist threat that could eand into the US, and they are our closest (literally) allies.
917	When it comes to security were all in it together you dope. In times of crisis we are as one.
918	It smells don't it. This is the plan to get Darren Wilson off. Period.
919	He did that quickly &amp; made moves. Like ok lets get that wheel spinning.
920	Smearing the victim, tainting any jury pool, dodging out of the real questions. This is definitely a calculated smoke screen
921	"that was their intent all along. Brown will be painted a ""thug"" and ""deserves"" what he got."
922	They're trying to skirt the situation &amp; take focus off of Darren Wilson. Who's left over to blame? Dead victim.
923	dm
924	Hopefully not - I'm seeing a lot of people who recognize that his involvement in the robbery is irrelevant to his execution
925	His filmed death, was an barbaric act of terror!
926	Someone should send that to Chris Matthews who acted as if all Muslims in France were terrorists
927	I'm not buying the bullshit that there's good Muslims. The Islamic religion is fucking evil.
928	Islamaphobe
929	not really, just pissed off. I'm against all religion.
930	I'm not a religious person either, but u slammed billion ppl. All fanaticism is evil.
931	I slammed Islam not the people. They need reformation and the lack of movement shows no interest.
932	I'll give you that.
933	Muslims have been given opportunity to reform and they refuse to do it.Where are the billion.

1043	you are saying that's mike brown in the picture? It's not. Two events unconnected. What's your point?
1044	I think is saying: tough guy in pic is low life scum whether it's the late Mr. Brown or not
1045	then what's the relevance?
1046	low life scum I think
1047	still unclear in the context of the shooting of an unarmed teen. But ok.

1400	Nothing justifies this horrendous crime but why always mess with Islam?? Zillion things out there to make fun of
1401	What I mean is that they know Muslims take no jokes when it's related to their religion, book or prophet. Why do it?
1402	why do it? Hmm, because that's how societies evolve, by breaking down taboos, accepting ridicule
1403	Thanks for the info. Is your server lagging?
1404	not lagging, just answered your original question: no one, no nation or faith system above ridicule
1405	Oh well, as u may have noticed, some ppl disagree with you!
1406	I respect their right to disagree with me and will defend that right, even if I disagree with them
1407	Because *not* to do it for any religion creates a class of people who can't be criticised.

1409	So Jon Stewart, John Oliver, Colbert, Private Eye all fair game? Freedom of speech includes ridicule.
1410	yes freedom of speech is v broad but some cultures r behind the anglo sans on self criticism, that's all.
1411	Freedom of speech shud never mean to give the press the right to trash others or ruin others image just bec they CAN

1454	This sounds like made up BS
1455	They have also evacuated Sydney state library but I have no idea why
1456	They have also evacuated sydney opera house due to suspicious package
1457	It's not made up but I think there is only offender with muslim flag &amp; local news didn't mention suicide belt
1458	Apparently a hoax. Best to take Tweet down.
1459	That’s the photo tweeted this morning claiming to be of the soldier who was killed.
1460	Not a hoax. This is before the shooting
1461	It's not a hoax, but it also wasn't taken *after* the shooting.
1462	Really? Why would somebody post this without saying that? Twisted.
1463	Because people like love stealing other people's pics to get RTs.
1464	That may be harsh. He seems to be honouring. Just unaware of source.
1465	Don't steal other people's pictures without attribution. Pretty simple.
1466	The soldier on the right is the one who taken by visitor moments before shooting
1467	this matches the photo tweeted earlier today from a tourist who says it was taken moments before the shooting. /2
1468	I don't believe there are soldiers guarding this area right now. /2
1469	That photo was taken before the attack.
1470	wondered as well. I've reached out to someone who would know just to confirm that. Hopefully get response soon.
1471	This photo was taken this morning, before the shooting.
1472	So honoured to serve as Honorary Colonel in reserves. Job is to honour citizen soldiers like these brave men.

1646	If they were criminals why did the police not arrest his friend right away?They shot one robber &amp; let the other go
1647	no he was walking IN the street big difference
1648	it's sound like they may have been racially profiling him as a suspect
1649	a story that continues to repeat itself, over and over and over in America.
1650	You are supposed to not be biased when you're a journalist. Glad you can come up with that decision without knowing all the facts
1651	this turned out to be a very popular tweet
1652	it sure did. A boon to my
1653	How? They are giving info that the media asked for.
1654	They are releasing irrelevant info that doesn't affect the case of Michael Brown's shooting
1655	They can't release shooting info cause they are still interviewing witnesses. Media wanted this info.
1656	They can't tie the two together cause they are separate issues. Releasing at different times puts distance between them.
1657	What case? It's totally cool to shoot unarmed people suspected of a crime!
1658	and that is part of what's distressing. Police screw up and make bad decisions in any system.
1659	to have the Supreme Court declare open season for cops on the population is a deliberate decision.
1660	For you to declare he was executed without any facts is also as absurd.
1661	I don't think i did say that. I did criticize a Supreme Court decision I've read many times.
1662	That's two different arguments.
1663	and that suppressing or selectively releasing info led to people deciding for themselves.
1664	it is! I both argued that the Supreme Court was wrong . . .
1665	and not releasing any facts is a real good way to make sure people pass judgment on the facts they have
1666	Not releasing facts about that shooting is also a way to make sure they get good info from witnesses.
1667	they've systematically only released information that makes them look good, even info that might taint
1668	What other info do they have ready to release? All they have said is this is why we approached him.
1669	Why wasn't Dorian Johnson arrested if he was suspected of a robbery?
1670	an investigative report on the shooting?
1671	What they did today was also a good way to taint the jury pool.
1672	P MUCH
1673	I don't understand the double standard of wanting all the info about the cop but Brown's past is safe.
1674	What they also did was chose to not ignore facts that call in to question the witness' credibility.
1675	There are several witnesses. They don't all know each other and they're all saying the same things.
1676	Ok, so you get accounts from the community he lives in where people already have a distrust in police
1677	why don't you check out the racial profiling statistics of the Ferguson PD? some real, hard facts.
1678	That right there tells me you are going into this with an agenda.
1679	that I don't like racial profiling and think police should obey the law? That is definitely my agenda.
1680	LOL
1681	No that you see this as a racial situation before you know anything.
1682	"Rand Paul, yesterday: ""Anyone who thinks race does not skew the application of criminal justice in this"
1683	"country is just not paying close enough attention."""
1684	Anybody who uses it at every opportunity falsely weakens the message.
1685	who says it's false? There's a large &amp; documented history of this PD arresting too many blacks.
1686	Rand Paul used those words BECAUSE of this incident. Just fuck off dude. Fuck off so hard.
1687	You're making an assumption about something based on other peoples actions, that's my point.
1688	then tell me the people of Ferguson haven't EARNED some distrust.
1689	Right there you just admired they are all bad witnesses if they have distrusts in cops.
1690	and you want to make a decision without any hard facts.
1691	You don't want to see what's happening? Fine. Keep being naive. Good day.
1692	I see a lot of people making assumptions with limited facts. We haven't even seen an autopsy report.
1693	autopsy report SPOILER alert: died from multiple gunshot wounds
1694	Was he shot in the chest or back? From ' away or ' away? Which wounds came first?
1695	They've already said he shot him once from the car. Christ.
1696	If he was shot in the chest or back is the biggest factor in who is right.
1697	What? No it isn't. There is definitely no justification for deadly force once he was running.
1698	If he was shot in the chest how was he running away?
1699	in your world, it's cool to shoot unarmed people in the chest, but not the back? Or vice versa?
1700	If he was shot in the back he was running away but shot in the chest he could have been charging.
1701	Yeah, I would totally eect a kid that's been shot to run away, get shot again, and decide to charge.
1702	Has that info came out yet?
1703	confused how an unarmed person, charging, retreating, or standing still, is a threat to a cop ' away
1704	Simple: Mike Brown was Inspector Gadget.
1705	Did you see him stand ' away and get shot? No. A few people who have a problem with cops did.
1706	"per chief belmar: ""a shot was fired inside the car, and Brown was eventually shot about feet away from the vehicle."""
1707	And there was a struggle inside the car. How do we know Brown didn't get the gun and fire the shot during the struggle?
1708	why would the ferguson PD and STLCO PD release the information they've released and fail to mention that?
1709	I'm relying on details agreed upon by the police and the witnesses.
1710	They didn't say who fired the shots in the car. The fact is we've only heard one side.
1711	there's a difference between an open mind and an empty one
1712	An open mind waits for all the facts then decides. An empty one makes a decision before the investigation is over.
1713	do you not even have a basic understanding why people mistrust police?
1714	I do, but do you have a basic understanding of the judicial system? Let's hear both sides then decide.
1715	dude, come on. This rogue cop apparently thought he was Judge Dredd and murdered an unarmed kid.
1716	So no matter that evidence comes out during the investigation that's what you're going with?
1717	UNSUBSCRIBE
1718	that's an account FROM THE STL CO POLICE CHIEF
1719	I blocked him, so you can leave me off the tweets. I won't see them, gives you more characters.
1720	ok
1721	everyone agrees he was shot once at close range and multiple times at + feet.
1722	He admitted they stole cigars to DOJ &amp; StL County PD. He wasn't charged b/c he didn't commit a crime.
1723	the investigation (e.g., that officer had a facial injury).
1724	also wrong venues and in wrong order. After his summary execution in the street, they are trying him through the media.
1725	Are you saying they start at the end and don't elain why he was approached by cops?
1726	At least they are thorough.
1727	I'm curious, had the suspect been white would the PD have acted the same?
1728	p sure you know the answer to that question.
1729	And that's the point. That's what people are upset about, I think.
1730	it's also pretty upsetting that a kid was summarily executed for maybe stealing a pack of cigars.
1731	Also per last press conf, local PD depts seem super disconnected and out of touch with African American community.
1732	I believe I read something like Ferguson is % white but the PD is % white.
1733	White or Black the biggest prob people have with police is the attitude from cops. We are a guilty till proven innocent society.
1734	strongly agree. I know policing is a terribly high-stress job, but most people are not criminals.
1735	Perhaps they need to alter/improve their training.
1736	Agree. Not worth the bullets whatsoever.
1737	Fit description would be more accurate.
1738	Even IF he did IF; he was still UNARMED &amp; shot MULTIPLE times. Does it JUSTIFY his killing NO!.
1739	"“: Police reports released this morning indicate Mike Brown was a suspect in a ""strong-armed"" robbery in ”"

1742	times out !
1743	that's problematic.
1744	and unfortunately we'll never hear the other side of the story because he's dead
1745	Exactly
1746	This would be more believable if they'd said it a week ago. No one believes it now. NO ONE.
1747	"“: Police reports released this morning indicate Mike Brown was a suspect in a ""strong-armed"" robbery in ”"
1748	Fuck that. Where is the report? Why was he unarmed? No. We demand justice.
1749	"Wait... “: Police reports released this morning indicate Mike Brown was a suspect in a ""strong-armed"" robbery in ”"
1750	so it was fine to just execute him in the street then
1751	How were the police so quick to indicate Mike Brown if all of this took place in a matter of minutes?
1752	"“: Police reports released this morning indicate Mike Brown was a suspect in a ""strong-armed"" robbery in ”So kill him?"
1753	all there is a still picture of a black man walking is that what counts as evidence were they on his person?
1754	"“: Police reports indicate Mike Brown was a suspect in a ""strong-armed"" robbery in ” Oh, please, of course it did"
1755	"All ""strong-armed"" means is physical force was used; term is being used deliberately so people get confused."
1756	oh yes. Clear that something occurred, death still not necessarily the right result.
1757	"""Strong armed"" is being used to obfuscate; sounds like the perp was armed, which he wasn't, &amp; the crime was SHOPLIFTING."
1758	attacks victim, leaves perp unexamined
1759	wait a min, I thought they said he was a good boy?
1760	Ironic since all the i witnesses say the officer was white. Now it is the black officer Darren Wilson who shot??
1761	So they're claiming a BLACK cop killed ? ?
1762	that is MY ERROR. There is no report confirming Darren Wilson is black. I retract my tweet.
1763	I haven't seen anyone say he was black. It is a somewhat common name.
1764	I retract my previous tweet. Darren Wilson's race is NOT CONFIRMED. I apologize.
1765	WHEN? he became a suspect upon the firing of the fatal shot?
1766	exactly
1767	We will not rest until there is Justice here. Even if true, Mike Brown did not deserve execution.
1768	Antonio French tweeted this vid days ago. Is this the same robbery and market?
1769	"Indicate? If he was a suspect why did the police stop his car next to him and tell him to ""get the f on the sidewalk"" ?"
1770	. GOOD POINT. cc
1771	"that's bs. there's always a ""history"" when the African Americans gets killed."
1772	It's a little scary to know they shoot and kill people suspected of crimes in Ferguson.
1773	A pack of cigarettes = strong armed robbery.... You guys are getting ready to stir the pot again.
1774	"""strong-armed""? But not actually ""armed."" Soooo, the use of deadly force against him? How can it be justified?"
1775	holding suicide prevention event and fundraiser for funeral costs for my cousin who passed on sun
1776	any help with this event even raffle prizes are much appreciated
1777	Doesn't matter. Cop still murdered him. We won't be distracted.
1778	Nothing in that video provides concrete evidence of anything,much less any kind of justification for cops murdering anyone.
1779	wheres the money if he robbed the place looks like a soda in that persons hand
1780	"so robbery can only be with money?Every time a black kid gets shot, all the black people say""He wasnt in the wrong"""
1781	so they killed him for stealing chips and juice gtfoh point is he was unarmed
1782	People act like he was shot because he was black, but if it was a white kid or a black cop no one would care.
1783	rather he was orange , purple or grey they dead ass wrong ... If it were your relative u would feel different .
1784	He struggled with a cop and went for his gun - that's what got his a$$ killed
1785	You do realize he didnt get shot because of that robbery? He was shot during protests and riots.
1786	to make him look like the bad guy.. Since there is no real reason for why they did it.
1787	It was to show his mentality. To prove that he isn't as innocent as anyone thought he was.
1788	exactly
1789	to make him he look like a thug ?
1790	Yes which from the video, he looks like thug. They are trying to make it seem like he could have done something to the cop
1791	oh please even if he jacked the cop up they have other weapons besides a gun
1792	So if someone was coming at you and beating the fuck out of you threating your life, you wouldnt shoot them if you could?
1793	if i were a cop &amp; he was unarmed ummm hello .. So he must've left his taser in the car ... ?
1794	the cop didnt know he was un armed he could have pulled out a gun and killed him, if he tazed him he could shot the cop.
1795	stepped in the wrong part of town, but just because cop shot someone its bad. get over it.
1796	he had no reason to shoot an unarmed person u sound ignorant enjoy ya day️
1797	he felt threatened so he took action, not saying hes in the right but that what happen
1798	Fists are weapons, he could have done anything at anytime he did what he thought was right he has a family to go home to
1799	the cop shouldnt have shot him. but just because he was black people care. people kill each other everyday because someone
1800	then why accuse him of a robbery if thats not why they killed him? Whats the point of bringing it up..
1801	he robbed swishers supposedly
1802	“: he robbed swishers supposedly” smh
1803	word, took a bullet for some swishers -.- we'll never know the whole story though
1804	“: word, took a bullet for some swishers we'll never know the whole story though” exactly they looking for an excuse
1805	there doesnt have to be money stolen/ just stolen itemsto be a robbery, they said it is robbery bc the use of force
1806	the picture isnt clear that could be anybody
1807	thats not what i was referring to, i was just saying it doesnt have to be money to be a robbery
1808	You guys are LATE with that video. It's been circulating for damn near hours now.
1809	oh please CNN cut the bullshit them dirty ass cops will say anything
1810	even going extreme length to hire an actor that looks like Michael brown! Not saying murder was justified, it's not
1811	i agree
1812	that being said, even if he committed the most awful crime on planet earth, he DID surrender. No reason to be shot.
1813	thankyou exactly my point
1814	no need to thank im with u that stealing a cnt cigar shouldnt trump a kid who had a future. We all do stupid shit
1815	this is just the beginning of the information!!!
1816	what about the FBI
1817	no offense u sir but unless he was reaching a gun then there was no reason for this to happen
1818	no offense taken sir and normally I would agree with you but their is more to this story.
1819	“: what about the FBI”
1820	do they count as part of the stupid LEO because their part of this investigation too. Video doesn't lie
1821	yeah they faked the video LOL racist denial
1822	“: yeah they faked the video LOL racist denial” oh please
1823	did you see the video? do you think the police faked the video? are you saying this ISNT Michael brown?? please
1824	did I say it was fake u , are u stupid or dumb? I said why show it now...
1825	
1826	WHY SHOW IT NOW???? because it is relevant you buffoon
1827	where is the robbery? All I see is a confrontation.
1828	you missed the part where he reaches in and takes these cigars? Passes them to his friend and takes some him self.POS
1829	again he could have paid for them
1830	smh

1951	EMERG DESC, set FL68, started descent and lost consciousness before able to set higher ALT? Seems likely...
1952	but at a controlled speed (unless readings were out), which makes it even more bizarre. I hope they find the real answers soon

1970	Well, that's a good idea too. But...they're gonna end up life in prison and that means that they're gonna live on taxes...
1971	French taxes... But the French don't treat prisoners as well as we do
1972	didn't the cops ask you NOT to give this kind of detail? what is wrong with you?
1973	so much for Local and Int'l Media adhering to a NO Publish of the building. Brilliant idiots as usual NBC

1975	these the same Islamic Terrorists you claimed were dead a couple days ago?

1977	the only reason why u don't kill them at this point is if u think they have info about future terrorist attacks.
1978	no they want to be martyrs they want to be killed it makes them Heroes to the other terrorists
1979	they are heroes to their followers no matter what. Don't give them a way to get out instructions to trigger future attacks.
1980	I don't think they are leaders the leaders don't do the real terrorism... But I get what you are saying tho
1981	they could be middle managers. They could lead a group.

1988	just curious: does 'evacuate' mean leave country or city/area? Do you know?
1989	means go home
1990	So scary. Hoping situation is resolved very soon &amp; as peacefully as possible.
1991	The country would be safer, for us that is.
1992	Hoping for a safe and speedy resolution. Praying no one is hurt but that seems unlikely considering.
1993	With their destructive foreign policy, I would think every day would require vigilance.
1994	What ?? Sorry I missed this !!
1995	maintain high level of vigilance? Against who? Obama said islamic terrorists don't exist in America remember?
1996	That's comforting

2510	Robbery involves threat or the use of force or violence to take the property
2511	right. So he did that for cigars ? I know I need to sit and read report. What's your thoughts on sll this
2512	so not even a felony... Haha
2513	it also says they didn't arrive on the scene for the first time until /13
2514	So there are already two different charges! And none of them shows Michael Browns name!!!
2515	Notice the top this says nd suspect. Mike Brown is suspect . Please read everything out there.
2516	Good look! Thank you!
2517	You're welcome!
2518	Items Stolen: - Items Recovered: - Fatally Shot Suspects: ...
2519	man. in so heated over this
2520	Could've been a count box which are ~$40. Box like this:
2521	If he stole a case of cigars, where were they?
2522	if they have the box it would be in evidence, but that's assuming this isn't just fabricated to create an excuse for the cop
2523	they have the whole thing on video..
2524	you have a link? or you just taking their word for it?
2525	it was on the news where I live.
2526	ok, have you seen the video?
2527	Actually it's pretty reasonable. Maybe do research before tweeting to the masses?
2528	lmap research before tweeting? pfft if anything this entire mess had showed research is the last thing people use
2529	Anon has been pretty awful through this whole thing.
2530	I meant in general. People went off the deep end and believed the st thing they heard or read. No matter how sided
2531	Oh for sure.. Anon has been exceptionally awful though!
2532	You should be focusing on the ROBBERY charge and not the SHOPLIFTING charge.
2533	$50 ?! Shit.. Mane this is some nonsense the report don't even look right. Missing info allat
2534	no signatures?
2535	I bet they just typed that up this morning.
2536	right. I made better report cards on Photoshop
2537	they're not finished yet, didn't want to sign rough draft.
2538	I think perhaps they’re saying the entire wholesale box a store would use for display…as opposed to one package.
2539	MT : We understand there are two gunmen and up to a dozen hostages inside the cafe under siege at Sydney.. ISIS flags on display
2540	More on situation at Martin Place in Sydney, AU
2541	yeah. That's her station
2542	This is not true. As you have made a lot of Tweets you may have forgotten this one. Do the right thing and remove it.
2543	Flag in hostage situation shows the Islamic profession of faith ('shahada'). Not an IS flag despite the same wording
2544	sorry - how do you know it's an ISIS flag? Can you actually confirm that?
2545	no she can't cos it's actually not
2546	Journalists report facts - reporters bleat out crap they hear. ISIS my arse.
2547	not ISIS flags. Shahada flags.
2548	not ISIS flags
2549	; several of your tweets are either wrong or misleading. Please hold yourself to higher journalism standards!
2550	Have you actually confirmed its an ISIS flag or are you talking shit
2551	. Your stupidity is beyond belief. Just stop if you are capable of that.
2552	there is stupid and there is Markson's stupidity which is on another planet altogether
2553	She is SOOOOO Stupid that she is completely incapable of realising it.
2554	I'm not watching it, but it sounds as if it is being treated as sport.
2555	It's called Dunning-Kruger effect.
2556	FFS, have you got a clue? There are people's lives at stake.
2557	who do you think you’re “informing”?
2558	Sure hope it's not just some dude and that you've not just pulled a Fairfax. Beginning to see why you were sent back to uni.
2559	“: According to Seven, this is a picture of the gunman ” - no idea how true this is but fascinating
2560	. Police have asked all on social media to desist publishing anything FHS
2561	if you can have a photo of this bloke then just snipe him in the head.
2562	put a bullet in the wankers head
2563	exactly what i was thinking
2564	there's of them though
2565	
2566	What is wrong with you ?
2567	Yeah, Murdoch witch, shut up and watch the blinking lights. You're not a journo, so don't journalise.
2568	dad?
2569	looks like a little green man!
2570	Stupid. Media learnt nothing from Boston.
2571	We learnt a lot from Boston nothing happened.
2572	You are a danger to the rest of society. Stop posting pics without any verification &amp; creating panic.
2573	looks like a bikie
2574	Your info is out of date. Rideau shooting didn't happen. Police press conference says nothing about number of shooters.
2575	Check for updates from police that are current.
2576	It appears now it was only shooter and the shots were heard at nearby hotel/shopping cntr causing reports of more shootings
2577	Probably a drill.
2578	: Police believe gunmen were involved in shootings in Ottawa and are looking for two shooters.
2579	That's not what they just said at the Press Conference!
2580	The police chief just totally dodged that question and wouldn't say there was more than ..jUst FYI
2581	And when will you be announcing they are Muslims?

2617	Okay, so what's been happening in Canada?
2618	Okay did quick search. Seems these are low level wannabe terrorists retaliating for Canada's stand against ISIS.
2619	The terrorists bit has not been confirmed as far as I'm aware. Last guy who shot up Parliament yrs ago was a nutcase.
2620	True. But I hear there was a similar incident this past Monday. Is that correct? That makes me think its low level terrorism
2621	A soldier was intentionally hit by a car driven by a radicalized person, also not really confirmed yet.
2622	Everything needs to be confirmed of course. It would make sense though if true though.

2676	Is that the video also?
2677	Any chance that's being said for fear of retribution?
2678	possibly. He seemed frightened
2679	now we now why!! Jeez!!
2680	or maybe the police scared him into saying it was michael brown in the first place?
2681	or is that impossible because the police would never be capable of unscrupulous behavior?
2682	I def did not say that. And even if it was I certainly don't think he deserved to die for it.
2683	and the last time i checked the eyewitness testimony overrides the testimony of the defident's friends
2684	that's why the police's testimony has been considered law despite it contrasting what EYEWITNESSES said
2685	Not by this kid.
2686	There are lots of us out there. Promise.
2687	we all need to unite then. solidarity is key in the face of adversity and prejudice.

2691	you seem to be the only one and that is a testament to your character miss.
2692	im not saying you did, but that is what has been implied the entire course of this investigation
2693	Somebody else probably did commit theft. Brown committed Robbery.
2694	actually I did use the word robbery
2695	"Brown's family attorney said in an interview today that the person in the video ""probably is Brown"""
2696	Your post states theft. What am I missing?
2697	"when I spoke to store owner, I said ""robbery"", tweeted ""theft"" in error"
2698	Thank you for clarifying. You definitely didn't have to reply to me. Have a great day and thanks for the reports
2699	""" Store owner told Monday that there was a theft, but said it was not MichaelBrown; said it was someone else"""
2700	I could tell it wasn't him when I saw the video.
2701	no doubt scared for his life. It's obviously mike brown in the video
2702	Obviously? So he took off his socks in the m between the video and getting shot?
2703	dude even his parents acknowledge it's him.
2704	And the store owner and the pictures say it wasn't. Why does someone who didn't see it matter?
2705	Dorian Johnson just confirmed it was them. What now?
2706	you just repeated what you said in the last tweet, p sure my reply doesn't change
2707	but you have two pictures of people with different clothes, and an eyewitness who says it wasn't him
2708	Good job getting (a guy who looks a bit like a) petty thief off the street (four hours after shooting him)
2709	it's obviously the same people and there's a confession
2710	Hey everybody, robbed a store. Can they shoot you down? Can I say that after they shoot you down?
2711	I'm not arguing that he deserved to be shot.
2712	Then what are you arguing?
2713	dude give it up. It's him. Confirmed.
2714	You get the last word here, I can't argue with everyone forever. Peace.
2715	snitches get stitches in the hood. Store owner knows.
2716	"looooool. ""snitches get stiches in the hood"" (noracist bro)"
2717	And also obliterating your attempt to deny that he was the person that robbed the store
2718	So he took off his socks but did nothing else to change his appearance? Obliterated, lol
2719	but reasonable doubt? Innocent until proven guilt? Nah, fuck it, let's execute him
2720	he seemed frightened
2721	"Y'all --&gt; "" Store owner told Monday that there was a theft, but said it was not MichaelBrown said it was someone else"""
2722	But Dorian Johnson already admitted they were in store and stole
2723	Where's With this breaking news? Police Chief making press conference.
2724	"think he was too scare to tell who it really was? How many '5"" men in Ferguson ?"
2725	why did the store owner say it wasn't him and the friend admitted it was? Have the gotten an elanation

2732	you scumbag
2733	Matt you clearly need too come out of the closet you fkn moron - what a ridiculous thing too say.
2734	yes there were tweets from inside the cafe. I assume some the hostages had feelings of empathy and sympathy
2735	Stockholm syndrome? What planet are you on?
2736	In pictures: the Follow live updates:
2737	Muslims, again.
2738	Extremist rather, no true Muslim will do such nonsense act! The world should know this by now...
2739	Muslims are a problem all around the world and your statement is false and a lie.
2740	I was trying to enlighten you on what a Muslim and Islam is cos you seemed so ignorant! Blame d person not religion
2741	jet so many Muslims around the world are a problem how do you elain that?
2742	Actually the ones causing the problem are less than % , the media makes it seem as if its the whole population.
2743	So % would be about million muslims, being a problem, trouble spots around the world, nothing to do w/ media.
2744	There are fallouts in every thing, unfortunately the fallouts here are taking center stage and denting the majority
2745	Awful! RT : the Follow live updates:

2754	The hostage taker possibly knows and is allowing them to be on their phones. I hope that's not a bad sign.

2875	so is uber paying for the rides paying the drivers?
2876	Uber is covering the cost of all rides.
2877	What is the wait time for a ride out of the Sydney CBD?
2878	Uber trips out of the CBD today are free to help Sydneysiders get home safely. See
2879	Thanks uber! I got everyone here at work now downloading your app
2880	Thanks for the free ride home today. I felt very safe and got home efficiently.
2881	Thank you!
2882	. Seems. A global marketing disaster Uber is trying to fix.
2883	for sure
2884	hikes prices during the . How is that helping? Giving away free rides would help.
2885	you're aware that this tweet ...is giving away free rides, right?
2886	Uber trips out of the CBD today are free to help Sydneysiders get home safely. See
2887	“: Uber trips out of the CBD today are free to help Sydneysiders get home safely. See ”
2888	who's paying then?
2889	Uber is.
2890	didn't make it very clear in the beginning.
2891	Uber is covering the cost of all rides.
2892	reports around the world flooding in of your % fare increase in response to a siege situation, smart.
2893	Uber trips out of the CBD today are free to help Sydneysiders get home safely. See
2894	Trying to get in contact, anyone at the phones?
2895	Uber trips out of the CBD today are free to help Sydneysiders get home safely. See
2896	what do you define as CBD? Where does the boundary end?
2897	. No, you refused to pay for them to be at the phones. Enjoy your walk.
2898	Uber is covering the cost of all rides, Uber is still paying drivers higher fares to encourage them to pickup rides
2899	Yes, that's excellent. What is the wait time for a ride out of the Sydney CBD right now? Are rides available right now?
2900	So are rides free or more eensive? Your tweet is very unclear
2901	The rides are free. will be paying the drivers the increased rate out of their own pocket.
2902	Uber trips out of the CBD today are free to help Sydneysiders get home safely. See
2903	Thanks
2904	Glad I'm not the only one who's confused ...
2905	Uber is covering the cost of all rides, Uber is still paying drivers higher fares to encourage them to pickup rides
2906	how about paying your drivers extra to go into the cbd instead of forcing others to pay extra to travel into potential danger?
2907	Uber trips out of the CBD today are free to help Sydneysiders get home safely. See
2908	brilliant, thanks for the reply. I'll share the link
2909	What do you pay your drivers?
2910	Uber is covering the cost of all rides, Uber is still paying drivers higher fares to encourage them to pickup riders.
2911	Yeah, I got that. Thank you for your great service.
2912	for the transport service I don't run? Excellent point sir. If they wanted to save money, they should've kept quiet.
2913	That is the point, dummy. Lots of drivers signing up for Uber. They are smarter than you. So help out and shut it
2914	wow, what an asinine remark. They went for a PR scoop and fucked it, now they're scrambling to fix it. Seems smart
2915	Listen up dum-dum. They ARE paying the drivers more. Reading is a skill.
2916	. No, they presumed their customers weren't economic illiterates. They presumed wrong.
2917	still looks like a PR issue to me, look at the backlash. Never assume the customer has same knowledge you do .
2918	Being literate in economics is out of favor these days. Bad for politics.
2919	FWIW I think they're communicating fine now, that initial tweet was a grenade they should've rewritten.
2920	. That initial tweet was on point. Their customers, and the outraged, should have been smarter.
2921	surge pricing is automated. When we became aware of the situation we capped surge pricing and made rides free for riders.
2922	how about you fuck off back to your corner of the internet where your opinion matters and I'll do the same.
2923	Man, you're dumb. Sorry for saying anything, dummy.
2924	so free or surge pricing?
2925	the surge rates are to draw the drivers there (uber will pay the cost). No fee to passengers.
2926	Ah that makes sense then thanks
2927	cut the BS they wanted to surge price now back tracking
2928	
2929	Uber is covering the cost of all rides.
2930	that's like the most confusing statement ever. The social media department of Uber Sydney is high or something?
2931	Uber trips out of the CBD today are free to help Sydneysiders get home safely. See
2932	I'm baffled by how few of its customers actually know how Uber works.
2933	that's better RT : Uber Sydney trips from CBD will be free for riders. Higher rates still in place to encourage drivers
2934	wait, does 'higher rate' mean what is paying drivers?
2935	Uber is covering the cost of all rides, drivers will still receive higher rates from Uber
2936	Yeah I think so. They're getting $100+, riders aren't wearing diff. Good gesture. Poor message transmission
2937	Uber is covering the cost of all rides, Uber is still paying drivers higher fares to encourage them to pickup riders.
2938	Uber trips out of the CBD today are free to help Sydneysiders get home safely. See
2939	Faster backflip than Tony Abbott!
2940	surge pricing is automated. When we became aware of the situation we capped surge &amp; made trips free.
2941	Well that's not true. First, you tweeted an elanation about why you were gouging customers.
2942	I still have some misgiving re &amp; earlier comm was confusing, but IMO they're trying.
2943	when you first became aware of the situation you tweeted that prices will increase.
2944	Uber is covering the cost of all rides, Uber is still paying drivers higher fares to encourage them to do pickups
2945	
2946	Yeah...too late
2947	at least they're righting a wrong. I'll grant them that.
2948	initial message did imply that riders can cop hike. Much better.
2949	thank you for fixing this situation.
2950	It is an illegal bloody service. Why don't you thank regular taxi drivers? Encouraging theft are we?
2951	what does this mean?
2952	Uber is covering the cost of all rides.
2953	thx.
2954	swarming because of a concert or event? Fine. Swarming during a hostage crisis? NOT COOL.
2955	calm down its one cafe.
2956	it's still raising prices when people are trying to leave the CBD in a crisis. At least they've made rides free now
2957	is public transport free?
2958	. Every can take a M40 $30 discount voucher. But then isn't public transport.
2959	no idea what you mean?
2960	Taxis all offer $30 discount to disabled passengers, doesnt even have disabled taxis to offer. That's true PT
2961	don't know if your being sarcastic or going of topic
2962	You called uber public transport, it's not. PT is for everyone not just the elite.
2963	I never called uber PT. Everyone is having a go at Uber but not PT... We own it,we shouldn't have to pay in desperate times
2964	U don't pay extra for PT at desperate ⌚. My apologies if I got the issue confused. I agree PT for everyone regardless of class.
2965	"people eect Uber drivers to work for normal/free in ""crisis times"" but when Uber increases prices get more drivers than"
2966	everyone cries how bad it is... Yet public transport is still usual price and no one is whining at them.
2967	Same people pro do sweet all but moan on social media about how terrible everyone else is.. And yes irony burning my end.
2968	I'm kinda new to (active) twitter but I can see the praises of a knee jerk reaction. It highlights the collective mind issues.
2969	I see your point. Maybe should make transport free from the CBD today.
2970	This is a ubers drivers forum, not sponsored by uber. Read what it's like in a mature uber market.
2971	Uber is covering the cost of all rides, Uber is paying drivers higher fares to get into the CBD.
2972	Only after backlash. Kinda like getting your hand caught in the cookie jar. ?
2973	nope. I respect them for making the rides free, I can also see how they wanted to get more drivers in
2974	so our GOVERNMENT is making money from people trying to get out of a hostage situation but you don't shout and yell at them...
2975	but you do Uber for trying to increase drivers. My work here is done your honour.
2976	you really gotta stop the swarm model or at least have someone actually look at WHY an area is swarming.
2977	wats happening?

2988	Uh! Oh. This is serious and officially out of control. I sure hope it wasn't false sighting or in more hot water
2989	True? “: CountyPD tell me ofcr shot a man who pointed handgun at him at Chambers/Sheffingdell at a.m. Man critical ”
2990	according to police that's the truth

3090	"""Bigotry: The Dark Danger"""
3091	isn’t ,000ft unusually high?
3092	yes and no depends on other traffic, turbulence... they were mins late so going higher = going quicker
3093	any idea why it'd flight so high? It's a short flight, usually planes go at ~ ,000 feet
3094	But no emergency call made? Or emergency squawk?
3095	Sent Mayday through radio. I suppose he had other things to do than adjust the Squawk
3096	Only takes a second to set the squawk code,
3097	yes but every second not spent trying to save everyone.....
3098	What's the use when you're crashing?
3099	It turns out there was no distress call made. I'm almost certain this was a hi-jacking now.
3100	Unless they became rapidly unconcious
3101	Anyway. Have to wait and see now.
3102	It looks like someone was flying it manually, all the way into the ground.
3103	For sure not, it was following exactly the same flight path as day before
3104	What I'm saying is, I believe it was deliberately crashed. Being controlled all the way into the ground
3105	Yep, it's follow exactly the route going down, that seems to suggest unconscious pilots.
3106	No, somebody had just initiated the descent, and might have been unconcious or dead just after that.
3107	If someone set the autopilot to fly it into the ground, the descent rate would have been constant.
3108	which seems to be the case.Constant descent, wind variations set aside..
3109	They're saying what I said, the crash was a deliberate act. Controlled flight all the way down.
3110	Or autopilot. But sure deliberately set.
3111	I don't think the autopilot was engaged.
3112	They're now saying the co-pilot deliberately crashed the plane.
3113	That's what they say.
3114	Would be good to get the data from the Flight Data Recorder though.
3115	The data from the transponder made it obvious.
3116	The transponder did not say anything. No sqwak .
3117	It only takes a moment to enter into the transponder. I've worked on these systems before.
3118	Autopilot was manually changed from ,000 to ft at :30:55 (Flightradar24 says)
3119	The autopilot wasn't set to feet. It was flown manually. FlightRadar24 has made that up.
3120	and have operated them in sumulators. Also on actual flights when I've been in the flight deck.
3121	Look at the time on each line. The altitudes are requested not achieved.
3122	But that's the FMC, doesn't mean autopilot was engaged.
3123	what's the use of changing FMC if autopilot not engaged?
3124	It changes the flight profile and cuts out the warnings and some of the protection.
3125	Have you operated a flight mqnagement computer before? I used to test them. What FlightRadar24 is ahowing is changes made
3126	the flight profile. That doesn't indicate that the autopilot was set to feet. I've worked on these systems, tested them
3127	It was obvious it was being manually controlled by the changes in descent rate. Also no
3128	distress call. I thought it was hi-jacked and being flown by then. If it's true that the co-pilot did
3129	crash it deliberately, the whole industry needs a shake-up.
3130	initially climbed to k ft before starting to descend and lost signal at k ft
3131	Any ATC available? Strange.....
3132	Sounds like a decent of fpm
3133	It's Harper's Canada though
3134	please wait on this. Also sounds like multiple suspects. People need to stay vigilant.
3135	might want to actually confirm shit like that before tweeting.
3136	I know what I'm doing here, thanks.
3137	there has been zero confirmation that gunman is down. Maybe let news outlets on scene handle the reporting.
3138	why shouldn't a private citizen make a comment on a news event?
3139	Not a comment. Stated gunman had been neutralized.Simply not true. Over k followers.Irresponsible.
3140	the news report I'm watching currently reported the same thing before Kelly tweeted it.
3141	Stated as fact before news outlets even suggested.Still uncertain.Leave news to news pros.Done here.
3142	maybe people shouldn't look to the tweets of comedy writers for their news facts?
3143	CBC news is reporting the gunman has been shot. Are you bitching at them also?
3144	I had confirmed the first gunman was dead when I tweeted.
3145	I had heard the same before I saw you &amp; many others tweet.
3146	you managed to confirm before any other news outlet in Canada. Bravo.
3147	Perhaps all of Twitter should follow HDM so we can learn the proper ways of Tweeting responsibly.
3148	"where's the ""(sigh) I give up"" emoticon? Do you not understand twitter?"
3149	I can get confirmation and video from witnesses and pass info along without a news producer. Simple stuff.
3150	maybe you should have a news crew on retainer just in case. Rapid deploy anywhere breaking news happens.
3151	they confirm facts before 'reporting'.
3152	"exactly, because they are ""journalists"" and ""dems the rules"" Kelly is a ""comedic writer"" no rules. Go police journalists"
3153	No, you're right. We should follow comedic writers and trust their sources. That's my first instinct.
3154	seeing as though I was % correct, yes.
3155	Kudos to your relaying of second-hand information! Do you have an app?
3156	hey kid, go enjoy this weird sense of power I've afforded you this morning. Spend it wisely!!

3159	yes from her newly decorated LA living room. Just like Egypt.

3225	the provoked.
3226	a provocation is an invitation !!
3227	in invitation to getting killed? you utter utter arse.
3228	You are a mad cunt go fuck yourself
3229	invitation to go how far?
3230	I'm too busy laughing to care.
3231	I feel provoked, luckily i believe in Liberty, o well words are wind

3235	To murder? In the name of a peaceful religion?
3236	....an invitation to grow the fuck up and stop being touchy, murderous bastards?
3237	Always the provoked of course, was that rhetorical?
3238	Omg!
3239	foreign policy is making Canadians a victim
3240	no, radical Muslim extremists are making us victims.

3243	your defense and justification of Islamic terrorism is disgusting

3246	are you for real?
3247	convo over. Trudeau is a windbag, name one good idea that he has tabled?
3248	you guys don't realize that harder is a snake and your lives are at stake because of him
3249	"Justins' new book spoiler alert. ""My dad was famous...the end"""
3250	I can't believe people focus on stupidity instead of real problems.
3251	these extremist infidels are the problem not our Govt
3252	when our sole purpose was to help civilians with humanitarian aid in the past under liberals
3253	your govt has changed Canada to a military nation...
3254	lives are at stake because of Isis and extremist snakes and cowards, not Harper
3255	wow you are dumber that I thought. Haven't you asked why Canada want in danger before?
3256	that's the Canada we want, not a Canada that wants to send its military all over ME
3257	that's cause Canada only focused on humanitarian aid and not military
3258	this has to be crushed to the point it won't rise again
3259	you are an imbecile and because of imbeciles like you, our lives are in danger
3260	you force that woman in your pic to dress that way?

3266	Liberals sent me and many more Canadian Soldiers to Afghanistan in the first place...
3267	is the only country needed help
3268	yes, but the liberals put us into direct combat by sending is to Kandahar. So why blame the CPC for this attack.
3269	Kanadar needs Canadian help, afghans welcome foreign help. Today Afghanistan is much better place thanks to Canada
3270	Yes it is, my point is though the liberals started us into this chain of events within foreign policy, CPC just continued it.
3271	I believe pushed it too far
3272	No ones even confirmed this was an Islamic attack yet.
3273	exactly so why did you or your friend already pointed the fingers at Muslims
3274	you did, you blamed our foreign policy to start with...
3275	I never blamed Muslims for this, I don't think you should be pushing vote liberal bullshit at a time like this.
3276	I just think we need a change
3277	perhaps, Trudeau is not that change. He's out of touch with most Canadians, he's not ready to run this country.
3278	if you remember Said the same about but he turned out to be a good leader despite all his critics
3279	I don't think he's a good leader at all, he's to involved in racial movements. Trudeau is better than Obama.
3280	Rather then point fingers, why don't you stand united with the rest of Canadians.
3281	That's two terrorist attacks under Harper and counting!
3282	the way is leading this government, there will be many more attacks on our
3283	"Never mentioned ""robbery"" in his confrontation with them...where is the corresponding dispatch call?"
3284	Corey, think we're gonna find out DWilson had no idea that MB had stolen Swishers. WAIT4 IT.
3285	Of course not...they have this fake police report, but no dispatch call detailing alleged robbery!
3286	time to arrest D Wilson, guys. Sorry, but shooting ppl u think are thieves isn't OK.
3287	: Cop never mentions shooting. Dispatch never mentions robbery.
3288	But they have had six days to come up with a narrative though!
3289	. - No narrative will justify actions after the d shot, surrendered, cop kept firing
3290	and that's cold blooded murder!
3291	You're right! Police said fight started after cop told Michael to get out of street, walk on sidewalk! He was never a suspect!
3292	are they calling Mike Brown a suspect? If so, why didn't he stop them and check them?
3293	I'm all types of confused.
3294	shits not adding up. What convenient store was robbed? Who are the witnesses that called it in?
3295	Another question, how would the police engage a suspect from INSIDE his vehicle? And, why not question nd suspect?
3296	that's what they took days to concort ?...those situations don't seem related at all
3297	They had splice some tapes together.
3298	how convenient for this police chief....he needs to just go
3299	theve acted the same even over a bag of chips
3300	Racist LIE to make it seem like innocent black child was a criminal. It will not work!! Police LIE may start more riots
3301	- Even if not innocent, no justification for violating rights, removing due process &amp; execution MURDER!
3302	Sov. Citizen in Dallas this week PLANNED TO KILL COPS and was brought in alive, how come a Shoplifter is denied same courtesy?
3303	He is innocent of any death penalty offense. Even if assault is involved.
3304	Absolutely!
3305	It doesn't matter if you are police, gang, or neighborhood watch. Life means more.
3306	I say no more /freekill. No matter who does it.
3307	The problem is that some police and others believe in a concept of a Free Kill.
3308	"- cop administered ""Street Justice."" Execution for alleged robbery, No go!"
3309	The let him die so he could not talk. Police station learned of shooting from the news not Wilson
3310	Absolutely my point!!
3311	Where there is just enough justification that a person thinks they can get by with it.
3312	Robbers do not just stroll down the middle of the street after robbing a store. IDIOTS
3313	Someone needs to elain how the cop shot &amp; then NEVER called an ambulance?
3314	. - Wilson knew he intentionally killed an alleged suspect trying to surrender to him &amp; people saw it.
3315	Michael never received emergency medical treatment, they left him in the street &amp; labeled the event
3316	I know : ( but sicker part is we don't know if Michael was dead or the let him die so he couldn't talk
3317	Police LIED 'Ferguson police chief: Officer didn't stop Brown as robbery suspect'
3318	a riot not a robbery suspect apprehended.
3319	IF Brown committed strong arm robbery is one thing,but cop response is still another entirely. No riots. Justice
3320	"Fri: Police LIED saying ""friend' confessed to robbery. NOW Chief says, he did NOT commit crime"
3321	It's a LIE. Police originally said confrontation started b/c cop told Michael to get out of street &amp; walk on sidewalk.
3322	"There are pics of ""strong arm robbery"" clothing description/size of assailant similar BUT cop deadly force? No!"
3323	Alasscan it's a lie. Pics are fake. No robbery was reported! If true, police would have said it last week to stop riots
3324	All a damn LIE. Plant the image of a violent black man &amp; say he was a suspect. DID NOT WORK!
3325	. - Even if robbery took place &amp; stop legal, actions after st &amp; d shot &amp; after put = MURDER
3326	Besides a person who committed a robbery wouldn't call attention to himself by walking in the middle of the street. It's a lie.
3327	IMO no shot should've happened. Call was unarmed suspect, cop had full description, easy to find where he lived
3328	Sadly friend of was in store also &amp; has admitted to it
3329	Police lied! Chief now says Michaels's friend was NOT involved in any robbery.
3330	"Heard that friend was not going to be ""charged"" in any robbery since video shows it was other person"
3331	Who is 'other person?' st police LIE saying friend confessed. Under pressure, they now say he was not involved
3332	st interview mentions cigarillos &amp; told lawyer. Video shows he gave back, not Mike
3333	Max are you listening to what the Chief of Police said or do you just want to believe lies? Listen carefully
3334	Don't understand your argument - we're both on same side. Was repeating what Dorian said. Also Chief walked stmt back later
3335	Now another store video out that some say shows DID pay cigarillos - confusing
3336	This shows Michael paid for cigarillos. No robbery, no crime! Pls RT
3337	Thing is Killer cop knew nothing -was just being a ASSHOLE BULLY-started to leave backed up-killed kid
3338	Dorian's lawyer said in CNN interview Dorian had admitted it as he give his witness statement
3339	Dorian admitted from day .Now rumor has it that store never called who called? tape?
3340	Makes me wonder since robbery report filled out day later. Also was cigarillo value raised?
3341	Chief admits 'friend' did NOT confess to a crime! Cop did not stop Michael as a suspect! LIES!
3342	I could not agree more, it just plain sounds preposterous. And why did he NOT get OUT of the car. It has to be a huge LIE.
3343	More like why was trying to pull into police car thru the window?
3344	. - Barney Fife would have tried to pull through a window too. Shades of Ernest T. Bass
3345	That makes no sense at all.
3346	Agreed, Dante!
3347	. - The Barney Fife fear is real in , total excessive force is common practice. This was a murder!
3348	Agree those Cops in are filled with so they hide behind military equipment, outrageous tactics
3349	Thank goodness the cops in aren't very bright. Makes it easier to sue their sorry asses!
3350	"It's not about smarts, it's that they never had to justify their actions ""Rubber Stamped"""
3351	To think after all this time a lame-assed story about stolen cigars is going to fly is beyond stupid!
3352	Affluent people and those in authority take it as an affront to be questioned, especially by lesser people
3353	AND that attitude will be their downfall too. Bet on it.
3354	Apparently they don't think people can think for themselves. How WRONG they are. Will live to regret it
3355	Yes!
3356	TYPICAL OF COWARDS AND BULLIES
3357	And at least Barney Fife would have been HONEST from the first hour.
3358	and his bullet would have been harmlessly in his pocket.
3359	YES!!
3360	A good question. I still think the cop was on drugs and hallucinating.
3361	The cops can't spin this unlawful shooting try as they may. Police Dept. credibility ruined with Ferguson community.
3362	. - Spin still doesn't justify the murder versus the arrest. Why did the officer not call for backup?
3363	There's no spin, cops blew it from day one by not releasing shooter's name! Trying to control the narrative w/lies.
3364	. - PD tried to justify probable cause, even st &amp; d shot, everything after = premeditated murder.
3365	Probable cause for what? The alleged robbery that cop wasn't aware of (so it appears) or alleged assault of cop?
3366	. - PD new story is trying to establish: probable cause, justify st &amp; d shot, but can't justify extras.
3367	There is a very fishy fishing eedition going on in looking for excuses for murder.
3368	| We need to see/review the statement by officer Wilson on what happened.
3369	Agreed-also,if was suspect,why not just question him? Why tell him &amp; friend get off road,not stop them?
3370	THIS IS MY FUCKING QUESTION!!!
3371	get outta d f'in road! (moreover). I'm sorry, time to call for the arrest now, of Mr. Darren Wilson.
3372	You were correct yesterday! Ferguson police chief: Officer didn't stop Brown as robbery suspect
3373	"Why did it take days for this ""info"" to come out? Looks like PD is looking for excuses for murder."
3374	. - PD trying to make case for probable cause, initial st &amp; d shot, but can't for execution w/Hands Up

3547	“: - At least five hostages in Paris kosher supermarket: (AFP) ”
3548	is this all part of a plan .. a spread of attacks by different associates to cause maximum confusion ..playing hostages . Max PR?
3549	Ok yes but why the outrage..police are human too &amp; make wrong decisions..what about when they get shot just protecting us!
3550	Hey on top of bein selfadmitted idiot : ) Yer also Retarted LOL + their Thugs
3551	you would be blown away by the swedish police then…
3552	Speak to them Moby, tell em!!!
3553	"fucked up police. ""Police""."
3554	Thanks for clearing that up. I was really confused about that.
3555	. a lbs aggressive young man might get shot if he attacks a cop.
3556	So what? The police still have to work within the confines of the law even if others do not.
3557	police are humans too and when confronted with that situation no training is perfect to predict a response
3558	not even if he IS stealing.
3559	“: to be clear: an unarmed teenager. I guess you were witness to the altercation between the cop &amp; the suspect if not shut it
3560	no but it shows this person's character and his disregard for the law and law enforcement this fact is highly relevant here.
3561	Yes but it does warrant being shot to death by the store owner. Its called Karma. Guy has a rap sheet as long as your arm
3562	agreed. Being shot for possibly stealing cigars isn't karma, it's excessive force that doesn't match the crime.
3563	Thank goodness for this: RT Charlie Hebdo gunmen's hostage freed and safe after police assault
3564	“: gunmen's hostage freed and safe after police assault” Hoping this is accurate.
3565	If so that hostage will be the person best able to give an insight into the attack, if the suspects were responsible...
3566	“: Charlie Hebdo gunmen's hostage freed and safe after police assault” Yes French police
3567	thanks GOD !
3568	aw
3569	and Charlie Hebdo's gunmen are dead!!
3570	Callum I'm so happy I was so scared!! Thanks for the support

3589	Brilliant! Lets arrest the entire police force for aiding and abetting.
3590	She has a valid concern. You offer a grossly exaggerated red herring in order too...?
3591	in Egypt, they killed 's and still free
3592	. In a world where white cops who murder shoplifting kids are free of responsibility for their actions.
3593	When is the police chief being relieved? He allowed the alleged cop who killed leave town!
3594	In the U.S.A. world.
3595	When you place him in the Whiteness Protection Program.
3596	in a valid world like ours. Where criminals are victims...

3720	“ Video manipulation takes time. RT If there's surveillance of a robbery why release stills &amp; not video? .”
3721	Where is the video from the cellphone taken from one of the witnesses who saw Brown shot and killed?
3722	It doesn't matter. The cop shouldn't have killed him. Also, I'd like to see the damn injuries the wussy cop had.
3723	Because it shows Brown negatively. The real issue is: Why did a cop shoot and kill an unarmed man, hands up?
3724	That's what you got from those looks like some1 pushing an old lady around.... no?
3725	is that even him in the stills?
3726	look at the shoes
3727	doesn't justify him getting shot several times.
3728	got me all wrong the robbery suspect is wearing sandals but michael is wearing tennis shoes- few mins later
3729	they did release the video..up to the journalists to post them
3730	It's easier to manipulate pictures than a video.
3731	To not telegraph their court case “: If there is surveillance of a robbery why release stills and not video itself? ”

3894	the photo does not show the soldier. It shows the response. Brave bystanders trying to save him
3895	my main issue was the picture. Heard your reporting on cnn thought you did a good job. Continue to be safe.
3896	You have a phone! Did you call for help? Nope. I took pics to sell and tweeted that I'm on CNN and ABC.
3897	Fuck you idiot
3898	stay safe. Hope you're never in the same situation.
3899	well said
3900	don't have to give cpr. Other ways to help. But yeah keep looking for profit. Great professionalism.
3901	"""professional, adjective: engaged in a specified activity as one's main paid occupation rather than as a pastime"""
3902	so yeah, eecting to get paid for doing his job seems pretty professional to me
3903	photography is his job? My whole issue was a man needed help. There are ways to help if you don't know cpr
3904	I didn't realize you were on the scene and could verify that he could have saved the life of the guy shot four times.
3905	Getting the word out about an active shooter situation seems pretty helpful, but please, tell us what you'd have done.
3906	we won't agree on this and that's okay. If you're in Ottawa stay safe.
3907	Call ? Signal for help? Keep an eye out for the rescuers? Simply ask the people if there's anything he can do?
3908	You don't have any evidence that he didn't do any of these things in addition to taking a picture, but you accuse away.
3909	Way to care for people.
3910	yeah posting information about an evolving shooter situation is less worthwhile than an untrained journalist performing CPR
3911	Reports of gunshots unconfirmed RT : Only photo I will tweet. CPR being performed on the soldier
3912	thank you for posting. It may just be hard to tell in the picture but bystanders look quite calm considering gunfire in area.
3913	Who the hell would shoot a protector of our freedoms, not a Canadian I hope !
3914	Freedom of the press my ass
3915	that's from last night. Not tonight.
3916	Is Ferguson joining Russia and China communist style of governance. The cops are calling the protesters animals.
3917	is this photo from last night?? Please clarify because you are using present tense.
3918	man these guys are such boneheads!!
3919	Why am I reminded of Tienanmen Square.
3920	what the fuck
3921	And FAA has declared a no-fly zone.
3922	~&gt; Gaza. Iraq. Soon they will burst into our homes, rape our babies, and force mothers to watch.
3923	cop shoots unarmed black man, citizens start looting and burning the community.is it me or does this not make any sense.
3924	Chef is on board
3925	These pigs need to be taken down!
3926	Yeah Land of the Free My A%&amp;
3927	And this isn't tyranny because ...?? Beuller??
3928	Source of info?
3929	Andreas Lubitz FB profile removed
3930	where did you hear that?
3931	U haven't sent Queen Bee Burley to France have u,if so it's only a matter of time be4 she comes out with a classic
3932	which means the phsyco is ruthless and will shoot all. Attack is best defence.
3933	Why would someone leave their ID-card? Thereafter allegedly seen at a gas station. Now hostage sit. Reports of
3934	a rd shooting at present Divert Operatons?
3935	Why state kosher grocery? You, nor any other news agency say Christian grocery if it would of been the case
3936	: AFP says gunman who has taken a hostage at kosher supermarket in Paris
3937	Presume they wanted a . So much for martyrdom. Why a kosher deli particularly?
3938	Doesnt sound like he has thought this one through
3939	looks like a deliberate attempt to split the French police action an cause confusion.
3940	Does he have a script to take away more freedoms.
3941	really sad situation
3942	Hunted Down, excellent police work, hope the other two follow soon
3943	Great post! Why Not post on Proximity Based Travel Network?
3944	did one of them drop his shoe? Surely catch those cunts
3945	
3946	bastards
3947	Just kill them.
3948	not men, not human, these are Zealots, the same beasts Mosses used in the murder of scores of ten when back from the mountain.
3949	maybe they should stop funding terrorists in Syria, Lybia etc. it blows back all the time. Remember Afghanistan in 's
3950	right one is inside the car
3951	this is mossad
3952	s of muslims russian ukranian &amp; africans die each day europeans dont care , why the world is so concerned with french death
3953	just my cents but URGENT is really not the best translation for СРОЧНО. just write “BREAKING” and we’d all be better off
3954	french death is not even worth discussing or spoken about compared to s which are killed by USA &amp; NATO bombing on daily basis
3955	OK Drills Since Where = Actual Terrorist Elosion
3956	All in the name of oil.
3957	Sickening. Frenchmen must demand and election and voted FN to get those swine out of their country. This is a MUSLIM problem.
3958	Islam does not condone such swine behavior or violence in anyway shape or form. Its a psychiatric problem,!
3959	When will Canadians wake up and realize this war on the Islamist rapist slavers is no game, no joke. Arrest them NOW !!!
3960	if reacts same as his home break in he will want full on Armed Forces assault on ISIS.

3966	not an Isis flag. Just an Islamic one. Stop spreading false rumors.
3967	Just read some Aussie news report so NOT spreading rumors. Grow up Nick.
3968	Interesting, because the Guardian says different.
3969	"The Shahada is not a ""group."" Basic googling skills help. Misinfo doesn't."
3970	Shahada on a black flag is a general Jihad flag that Al Qaeda/Al Nusra etc.. use.
3971	Sure. But to link to ISIS is factually inaccurate and irresponsible.
3972	What if it's Lone wolf? Immediately giving credit without fact checking favors them.
3973	Does it actually matter?
3974	Agreed, I have been pointing this out btw
3975	no.

4004	this is heartbreaking.
4005	Rip
4006	R IP NATHAN !
4007	Isn't it too late a NEWS...
4008	Just for the sake of good journalism, which one is it?
4009	fullstop for all Non
4010	He is human. That's what matters most. No one is asking of religion. Life is life.
4011	blast this..
4012	how does printing this picture of a murder help?
4013	Islam never Support Terrorist &amp; I'M Proud to be an Islam
4014	I remember in high school when we learned about Islam there was an emphasis on peace
4015	
4016	I thought you'd been an honourable exception not using that photo on your front page. I wish you'd use your freedom more wisely
4017	absolutely disgusting! Using someone's absolutely terrifying murder for own gain. What about their family?
4018	I don't need to see that photo to know what happened was. You could publish this instead
4019	exactly!
4020	“: The last person killed in Charlie Hebdo attacks was Muslim police officer ”
4021	Islam never Support Terrorist.
4022	Showing his face in his final moments is crass insensitivity and totally unnecessary - his family are grieving
4023	totally agree with you
4024	I totally agree with you!
4025	Well said, I agree.
4026	agree A Murphy
4027	Was the last person a human being?
4028	Sad. Islam is such a good religion but it has been taken over by criminals who unfortunately use Quran to defend themselves
4029	Islam never Support Terrorist
4030	Do we know the person has a gun?
4031	Ray Hadley, the worst muslim baiter in the country? You listen to that nitwit.
4032	speculation is NOT Journalism
4033	. Fuck, if I was being held hostage, literally the last person on earth I would want to hear from is that cunt
4034	who believes Ray Hadley?
4035	shoot him where his willy is since islam cherish it sooo much.
4036	prefer to listen to Hadley than the terrorist deniers at their ABC
4037	A bit like Hadley then? “: Ray Hadley spoke with hostage &amp; could hear the gunman barking orders demanding to go live on air”
4038	Why isn't he putting that call through to the police? Should be focused on helping, not media coverage.
4039	is Ray prepared to go in wearing a wire?
4040	There must be a way to enter that building?
4041	Report responsibly!
4042	could this be a response test by terrorist group about our emergency and anti terrorist services
4043	Stay safe my brothers in blue
4044	more to come??? more than boys???
4045	got feed in English or Spanish? I don't speak French. thx
4046	Seems france has gota real deal these dayss ! say safe ppl !
4047	Now it's too late. The harm has already been done.
4048	Condolences to all who loved him. We know, all too well, what you are going through.
4049	ok I'm really pissed off now
4050	
4051	I am so sad and disgusted that some coward has done this to of our soldiers now. I am livid.
4052	so what
4053	Support a to avoid giving the hostage takers a platform for their message &amp; risking future copycats
4054	you say what? Blackout? How will the hide the budget then?
4055	...It's Jihadists. Copying dumbassery has kind of been their bag for centuries.
4056	Allah means God. Why would you translate inconsistently and selectively like that? Oh, never mind. I know why.
4057	so why can't tell us the same
4058	good to see somebody did some research
4059	Not a great comfort but an important detail to emphasise.
4060	same shit
4061	it's a Sunni flag. ISIS are Sunni. So are Al Qaida. Blackunni. Greenhia.
4062	Muhammad would be the guy with the yr old wives and the order of death to infidels? What's the diff?
4063	Go get the Isis thugs NOW !!!
4064	apparantely this loner is not isis, and I don't think cowboy comments like this help right now.
4065	so its not an IS flag - must be a peaceful Islamic extremist group then!
4066	It is according to this terrorism eert
4067	I was being facetious as it seems media and the left go out of their way to minimise islamist terror threat
4068	I know, it was mostly aimed at but thought you would also be interested in that piece
4069	wsy too many pc apologists with their heads up their arse . Should get ready to kiss it goodbye
4070	So it's not ISIS but Islam in general. Much better... better think up a new word
4071	Agree when left/muslims deny IS is islamic it is a clear cut case of
4072	
4073	it will still be
4074	"""phobia"" =""irrational fear "". The"" civilised "" world is just""sick"" of these animals."
4075	Who cares about the flag, the people being held hostage are more important.
4076	there is something really wrong with these people. Ert them back.
4077	along with all life hating alan vomit jones listeners too, thatd help, the redneck brigade.
4078	People should be kind to each other and live together no matter which religion.
4079	yeah send them to Kobane in Syria..
4080	then I guess we all don't need to worry???
4081	". Isn't the Arabic for God, Allah? So shouldn't it be - ""There is no god but the God, Muhammad is the messenger of the God"""

4092	Seriously? Likelihood that it's an ISIS attack and THIS is your response???
4093	, you pick a fight with people you better eect something in return , we use to be peacekeepers ,so be careful what you get
4094	"Have u read this paper from Muslm Brthrhood? From . We did NOT ""pick a fight"". They brought it HERE."
4095	You're an idiot.
4096	, I guess your a fan of the fascist Stevie and his band of crap , so that tells me what you are !
4097	things aren't as black and white as you may think. Picking a fight on Twitter isn't cool, bro.
4098	, sorry about the soldier who died , terrible , no disrespect meant , don't believe gov't course is correct
4099	, everyone is entitled to a opinion , no fight here , you don't know me , I don't know you
4100	I definitely hear that and agree
4101	I hope they are being taken out of their offices and thrown out on to the street.
4102	reporting soldier shot in Ottawa. Very sad news.
4103	OMG.
4104	
4105	Chris. Not about guns. about Canada and Isis.Muslim extremist ran over two soldiers in Quebec. Blame Harper for allowing cars
4106	: Shooter still on loose after uniformed soldier shot at 's War Memorial, across road from Parliament.
4107	the internet says lol
4108	Just shoot him! Marksman have clearly had enough opportunities to do so
4109	If they shoot him in the head no bomb will go off. Islamic scum. These wankers are deranged.
4110	This has nothing to do with Islam, just like ISIS...
4111	It has everything do with Islam. U dont see the Jehovah's witnesses cutting heads off &amp; bombing people!
4112	No. It's fanatics. All religions have extremist factions and they're all wrong...
4113	a Jehovah's witness extremist?Mormon extremist?Roman catholic extremist? Etc. Non existent! Muslim...???
4114	I know that. Perhaps Islam reacts very very late on everything the Catholic Church has done centuries ago
4115	peaceful religions. U only have to read the Quran and u can see why these bastards carry out such terrorism
4116	They don't know whether or not he has a booby trapped bomb attached to his person.
4117	He's either got a dead mans switch in his hand or he hasn't. Surely they can get this intel from the released hostages?
4118	It's all over now, but I would think those hostages were too traumatised to remember any details.
4119	
4120	very bad to c tensed situation at sydney cafe...terrorism shuld be wiped out of the world once for evr
4121	well done to all for doing whats right
4122	And Well Done for taking it down.

4144	Hunt them down like the animals that they are!!
4145	there is far more tragedy than raw, unclothed, animality here.
4146	The tragedy is that we are allowing these people in to our country. Don't know what the hell you're talking about!!
4147	all I am trying to point out is that has never been very useful to anyone.
4148	"I think that what they are doing around the world is ""sensational"". It's about time we matched it."
4149	I think that what you are saying is very dangerous, and exactly what is wrong with the world we are living in.

4151	Fear has always been easier to manipulate than courage.
4152	Blah blah....bleeding heart!!!!
4153	So what they are doing is right??? You're wacked!!! You should be on a list!!!
4154	more than anything we need sobriety, not sensationalism.
4155	MT : Gunman shot dead inside Parliament; police believe there may be others on loose. Soldier shot earlier at War Memorial
4156	Ok so he is dead, understanding he was a huge threat....BUT now WE will NOT know~who or why?
4157	a safe bet?
4158	Its a religion of peace .. we don't write Jesus on bombs ...
4159	"“: Gunman's headband reads, ""We are your soldiers O Muhammad"" ”"
4160	Muhammad had never wanted to hurt innocent people. This men are soldiers of the devil, not Muhammad.
4161	i thought head band reads: if u can read this it's well within range of your rifle.
4162	Ok clearly what i'd read was wrong
4163	
4164	Have you seen this?
4165	"“: Gunman's headband reads, ""We are your soldiers O Muhammad"". ”"
4166	The west needs to wake up to radical Islam. And quit picking on israel building some houses.
4167	BS. More Muslims r killed by Muslim countries.
4168	. JFKerry(D) just appeared on TV to elain the gunman is so NOT Islamic... I'm relieved
4169	Meanwhile, these nutbags still allowed to threaten to kill Muslims and brown people.
4170	Well you don't want to read too much into that.
4171	Could be a red herring!
4172	mohamed would NOT approve of their action or the action of all those killing in the name of Iislam
4173	these people are but a tiny minority but sadly contaminate world opinion
4174	Problem is the ,6 billion muslims that are silent abt these acts.
4175	not so just that elements in press don't want to report the bigger picture - have their own agenda
4176	And what agenda would that be. Certainly not Pro-Israel. Lol.
